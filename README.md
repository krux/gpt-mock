A test library to mock out the Google Publisher Tag library.

## Installation

You can include `gpt-mock` using *npm*:

```console
npm install --save-dev gpt-mock
```

## Accessing

### ES6/ES2015

```javascript
import GPT from 'gpt-mock';
```

### AMD

```javascript
define(['gpt-mock'], function(GPT) {

});
```

### CommonJS

```javascript
var GPT = require('gpt-mock');
```

## Usage

This library is used to mock out the Google Publisher Tag (GPT) library, so the most natural
way to use this would be:

```javascript
window.googletag = new GPT();
```

Note that the instance is left as "unloaded", meaning `apiReady` will be false, and `googletag.cmd.push` will only accumulate the functions.

To mark the tag library as having been loaded, use the following:

```javascript
window.googletag._loaded();
```

This library is intended to be as API-compatible as possible with the production code.  Any member
that starts with an underscore (`_`) is not part of the API and is a mock implementation detail.

## Environment

The project requires nodejs (>=5.6) and npm (>=3.6.0) for development. It has no runtime dependencies.

## Developing

Check the code out and install the development dependencies using:

```console
npm install
```

### Building

To build the code, run

```console
npm run build
```

### Linting

We use ESLint and JSCS to do static analysis of the JavaScript and keep things smelling good.  To run both, use:

```console
npm run lint
```

### Testing

Using [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org), the [Mocha](http://mochajs.org) unit tests are run on every commit using PhantomJS to run the tests
with a real browser.

To test the code locally, you can use:

```console
npm test
```

To run tests in Test-Driven-Development mode, where the test will be run after every change, use:

```console
npm run tdd
```

## Issue Guidelines

Please either add a failing [unit test](./test/unit) or include a [jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net) that distills and reproduces the issue.
